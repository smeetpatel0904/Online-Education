                <p class="small">Education is the process of facilitating learning, or the acquisition of knowledge,
                    skills, values, morals, beliefs, and habits. Educational methods include teaching, training,
                    storytelling, discussion and directed research. Education frequently takes place under the guidance
                    of educators, however learners can also educate themselves. Education can take place in formal or
                    informal settings and any experience that has a formative effect on the way one thinks, feels, or
                    acts may be considered educational. The methodology of teaching is called pedagogy.

                    Formal education is commonly divided formally into such stages as preschool or kindergarten, primary
                    school, secondary school and then college, university, or apprenticeship.

                    There are movements for education reforms, such as for improving quality and efficiency of education
                    towards applicable relevance in the students' lives and efficient problem solving in modern or
                    future society at large or for evidence-based education methodologies. A right to education has been
                    recognized by some governments and the United Nations. Global initiatives aim at achieving the
                    Sustainable Development Goal 4, which promotes quality education for all. In most regions, education
                    is compulsory up to a certain age.</p>

                <p class="small-1">The education sector or education system is a group of institutions (ministries of
                    education, local educational authorities, teacher training institutions, schools, universities,
                    etc.) whose primary purpose is to provide education to children and young people in educational
                    settings. It involves a wide range of people

                    Schools deliver education, with support from the rest of the education system through various
                    elements such as education policies and guidelines – to which school policies can refer – curricula
                    and learning materials, as well as pre- and in-service teacher training programmes. The school
                    environment – both physical (infrastructures) and psychological (school climate) – is also guided by
                    school policies that should ensure the well-being of students when they are in school. The
                    Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development has found that schools tend to perform best
                    when principals have full authority and responsibility for ensuring that students are proficient in
                    core subjects upon graduation. </p>

                <p class="small">Technology plays an increasingly significant role in improving access to education for
                    people living in impoverished areas and developing countries. Online teaching is here to stay. Many
                    students prefer the online classroom since it offers flexibility in their busy schedules. With the
                    proliferation of information and knowledge, students must become lifelong learners in today's world,
                    and online education plays an important role in helping individuals access the learner-centered and
                    self-directed instruction.</p>
